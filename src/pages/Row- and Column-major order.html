<p>Anything you do with columns you can do with rows and vice-versa. This allows us to choose how we want line up entries in our matrices.
Switiching between them is also trivialy since it is just a transpose operation.</p>
<h5>Computers</h5>
<p>From a memory point of view, column and row-major order indicate whether columns or rows are laid out in continious memory.</p>
<p>but in programming languages, <em>row-major order</em> is slightly more intutive because we write <em>dimensional arrays</em> and vectors as rows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C">const float mat[][] = {{1, 2, 3},
					   {4, 5, 6},
			           {7, 8, 9}};
float matd[3] = malloc(sizeof(mat[0][0])*3);
// in this example, {4, 5, 6} is copied to 'matd'
memcpy(matd, mat+3, 3 * sizeof(mat[0][0]));
</code></pre>
<p>A lot of still use <em>column-major order</em> because it is not often that we write constant matrices in code so it doesn't matter too much.</p>
<ul>
<li>Column vectors are also more ubiquitous in mathematics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The decision of choosing to line up elements in rows or columns is preference, but here are some conventions:</p>
<h5>Systems of Equations</h5>
<p>For systems, we usually use column vectors for <em>unknowns</em> because it looks nicer. As a result, coefficients of an equation must be lined up in rows for matrix multiplication to work correctly.</p>
<h5>Cofactor expansion</h5>
<p>I usually line up basis and vectors in rows rather than columns because that's what I'm used to. Some people use columns.</p>
