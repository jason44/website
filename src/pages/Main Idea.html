<h3>Kernel</h3>
<p>A nxn kernel that <em>sweeps</em> over the source image. Each point of the new image is a result of a single operation in the convolution function.</p>
<p>In practice, the result is that each point of the new image is based on some function of the local neighborhood of each pixel.</p>
